my mom doesn't like lines, and waiting in lines, and money is often one of the primary ways she evaluates things. we went for ice cream the other night and the first remark was a scathing condescension of the line, of its length, of the way it wound through the parking lot, and of the brainless morons who were complicit in standing in such a line. her second remark was to wonder how much cash the place was making on an evening when the town had such a remarkable taste for ice cream.

i think its pretty common to be this way, to use money as a way to judge a thing or to describe it.  there are probably more interesting ways to participate in life than by considering the costs of things. my blind spot is almost certainly drink, rather than money. how does drink distort a man's idea of his company?  there was a Hemingway scene i recently read in "the sun also rises" where the narrator is in a restaurant with his homies, but truly he is disgusted and hateful of his companions but he begins drinking and everyone becomes really nice. everyone becomes really nice due to the poison he has taken that has fogged his perception.  the role that alcohol plays in sustaining mediocre or bad relationships is very interesting.

for this reason i can understand and admire someone who gives up alcohol.  but im not ready to give up meat.  the cheese burger, the fried chicken, i have yet to be humbled by the world in such a way that i can see the path for no meat but i'm closer now to seeing that it could be possible.\n`
